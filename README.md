# music_id

## Description
This code aims to classify songs into two music genres, Rock and Hip-Hop, using machine learning techniques. The classification is based solely on song information derived from the available data without the need to listen to them.

The project involves analyzing the data using Pandas, aggregating information, and creating graphs with Seaborn or Matplotlib. The scikit-learn library is then used to train a model to classify songs based on features such as energy, acousticness, tempo, and danceability.
